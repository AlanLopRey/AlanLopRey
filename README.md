## üõ†Ô∏è Tech I use (and why)

- **React / Next.js**: Fast, flexible, great ecosystem
- **Firebase & Supabase**: Easy backend to validate ideas quickly
- **Tailwind / CSS Modules**: Component-friendly styling
- **GitHub Projects**: Personal kanban and roadmap tracking
- **Figma**: Visual flows to guide UX decisions

## üß† I care about:

- Ship fast, but also ship MLP products
- Developer experience & clean abstractions
- Logical UX flows (user psychology meets product)
- Making small features feel like magic
- Writing code that can survive refactors
