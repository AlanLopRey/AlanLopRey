# Alan Lopez ‚Äî Frontend Developer with Product Thinking

[Versi√≥n en espa√±ol](./README.es.md)

## I have strong focus on product design, software architecture, business logic and user behavior.

I‚Äôm Alan, a frontend developer with a strong focus on product logic and architecture. I specialize in building scalable apps that connect UX decisions to business outcomes.
My latest project, Strongest Pomodoro System, reflects this focus, combining behavioral design with clean architecture.

## üöÄ Strongest Pomodoro System

This is a productivity app designed around behavioral UX principles.  
Built as a complete web and mobile product (mobile in progress), from design to code.

- MLP built with Next.js, BaaS solutions, custom hooks, and data visualization with D3.js
- Modular feature-first architecture
- Real-time DB sync and state persistence
- Monetized with Google Ads (in process)
- Custom service workers for offline use

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech I use (and why)

- **React / Next.js**: Fast, flexible, great ecosystem
- **Firebase & Supabase**: Easy backend to validate ideas quickly
- **Tailwind / CSS Modules**: Component-friendly styling
- **GitHub Projects**: Personal kanban and roadmap tracking
- **Zustand**: a lightweight and easy-to-use state management system, sufficient for my project.
- **Figma**: Visual flows to guide UX decisions
- **Obsidian**: to document the process, ideate, write down features, break down requirements, write down hypotheses to resolve bugs
- **AIs**

## üß† I care about:

- Ship fast, but also ship MLP products
- Developer experience & clean abstractions
- Logical UX flows (where user psychology meets product)
- Making small features feel like magic
- Writing code that can survive refactoring
